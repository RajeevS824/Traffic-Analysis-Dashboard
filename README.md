# Traffic-Analysis-Dashboard
A Streamlit dashboard that cleans, analyzes, and predicts traffic stop outcomes using real police traffic data, helping law enforcement and policymakers identify patterns and improve road safety.

Project Overview

This project is a Traffic Police Data Analysis and Prediction Dashboard. It automates the process of cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing traffic stop records to provide actionable insights for law enforcement and policymakers.

Here’s a clear description you can use for your repository and project explanation:


Steps Done in the Project

1. Data Cleaning

   * Loaded raw traffic stop data from an external source.
   * Handled missing values by removing incomplete records.
   * Dropped unnecessary or redundant columns.
   * Saved the cleaned dataset for further processing.

2. Database Integration

   * Connected to a MySQL database.
   * Inserted the cleaned data into a database table for efficient querying.

3. Dashboard Development (Streamlit)

   * Created an interactive web dashboard.
   * Users can view the dataset, add new traffic stop logs, and predict stop outcomes.
   * Implemented a traffic-light simulation to visualize prediction processing.
   * 
4. Data Analysis and Prediction

   * Designed queries to extract insights like:

     * Most common violations.
     * Arrest rates by age, gender, and country.
     * Vehicle numbers most involved in searches or drug-related stops.
     * Time-of-day analysis for traffic stops.
   * Predicted outcomes and violations for new traffic stop entries based on historical patterns.

   Metrics and Visualization

   * Displayed key metrics like total stops, arrest rate, drug-related stop rate, most common violations, and peak stop times.
   * Used columns and styled summaries for easy interpretation of results.
