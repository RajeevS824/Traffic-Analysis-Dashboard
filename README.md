# Traffic-Analysis-Dashboard

A Streamlit dashboard that **cleans, analyzes, and predicts traffic stop outcomes** using real police traffic data, helping law enforcement and policymakers identify patterns and improve road safety.

## Project Overview

This project is a **Traffic Police Data Analysis and Prediction Dashboard**. It automates the process of cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing traffic stop records to provide actionable insights for law enforcement and policymakers.


## Steps Done in the Project

### 1. Data Cleaning

* Loaded raw traffic stop data from an external source.
* Handled missing values by removing incomplete records.
* Dropped unnecessary or redundant columns.
* Saved the cleaned dataset for further processing.

### 2. Database Integration

* Connected to a MySQL database.
* Inserted the cleaned data into a database table for efficient querying.

### 3. Dashboard Development (Streamlit)

* Created an interactive web dashboard.
* Users can view the dataset, add new traffic stop logs, and predict stop outcomes.
* Implemented a traffic-light simulation to visualize prediction processing.

### 4. Data Analysis and Prediction

* Designed queries to extract insights like:

  * Most common violations.
  * Arrest rates by age, gender, and country.
  * Vehicle numbers most involved in searches or drug-related stops.
  * Time-of-day analysis for traffic stops.
* Predicted outcomes and violations for new traffic stop entries based on historical patterns.

### 5. Metrics and Visualization

* Displayed key metrics like total stops, arrest rate, drug-related stop rate, most common violations, and peak stop times.
* Used columns and styled summaries for easy interpretation of results.

## Real-Life Problem Solved

* Helps traffic authorities **identify patterns** in traffic violations and arrests.
* Enables **data-driven decision making** for law enforcement strategies.
* Assists in **resource allocation**, like targeting peak hours or high-risk areas.
* Provides a **predictive tool** to assess likely outcomes of traffic stops, helping officers make informed decisions.
* Improves **transparency and reporting**, offering clear dashboards for management and public insights.
